######## WordCounter.java
The WordCounter file right now only calculates the frequency for the training data set. To Calculate the Frequency for the testing data set just need to 
make 2 Maps for the training dataset spam and ham. As well as add a bit of code to the processFile method(mainly just a copy and paste thing of the code already
in there for the training data set). Will add it tomorrow morning/afternoon or u can add it if u want. I commented what I did so it should be easy to understand.
