This program is trained using a bunch of emails already classified as spam or ham and then is able to use that training data to predict if a certain email is spam or ham. It then displays how accurately the emails were classified as spam or ham

##### Improvement to Spam Detector
To improve the spam detector,we added a class called Optimize to remove words that appear less than a given number of times. Both accuracy and precision were both increased by about 4 percent.
